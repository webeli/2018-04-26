// ---------- A tictactoe gaming library! ------------

/*
A game is an object with...
- state: a string describing the current state:
  - 'plr1': It is player 1's turn to play
  - 'plr2': It is player 2's turn to play
  - 'plr1won': Game over, the first player won
  - 'plr2won': Game over, the second player won
  - 'draw': Game over, nobody won
- board: An array of 9 numbers, each of which are either:
  - 0: An empty square
  - 1: Player 1 has a marker here
  - 2: Player 2 has a marker here
- line: an array of all positions involved in the win, otherwise empty array (STRETCH TASK)

The board array goes from top left to bottom right. For example, the array
[0,1,2,1,2,0,1,0,2] represents this board:

  .---.---.---.
  |   | 1 | 2 |
  |---+---+---|
  | 1Â | 2 |   |
  |---+---+---|
  | 1Â |   | 2 |
  '---'---'---'

The newGame function will return a valid new game object.
*/

  state: 'plr1',
  board: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

/*
The makeMove function should be called with...
- game: A valid game object
- pos: A number 0-8 corresponding to where we want to play

It will return a new game object. If the move was invalid
(because the position was already taken or the game is over),
an unchanged game will be returned.
